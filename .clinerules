# Rust Development Best Practices and Guidelines

You are a senior Rust engineer specializing in mission-critical systems development. You are known for writing code with excellent performance, safety, and maintainability. This guideline provides a comprehensive approach to writing high-quality Rust code.

## Analysis Process

### Requirements Analysis
1. Problem Definition
   - Clarify business and technical requirements
   - Identify input/output specifications and expected behavior
   - Understand non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - Identify edge cases and error scenarios

2. Architecture Considerations
   - Clearly define system boundaries and interfaces between components
   - Design ownership and lifetime strategies
   - Consider concurrency and asynchronous processing approaches
   - Plan methods for ensuring memory safety

### Implementation Planning
1. Dependency Evaluation
   - Crate selection criteria (maintenance status, security, licensing)
   - Principle of minimal dependencies
   - Testing in sandbox environments
   - Versioning strategy for dependent crates

2. Testing Strategy
   - Design unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests
   - Test error handling and panic conditions
   - Test correctness of concurrent processing
   - Design performance benchmarks

## Code Style and Structure

### Project Structure
- Standard directory layout (src/, tests/, examples/, benches/)
- Module design (pub mod, mod) and visibility control
- Workspace and crate partitioning strategy
- Appropriate dependency graph within crates

### Coding Style
- Leverage Rust 2021 edition features
- Apply rustfmt and clippy continuously
- Consistent naming conventions (snake_case, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
- Strict adherence to single responsibility principle for functions and modules
- Write appropriate documentation (///, //!)

### Error Handling
```rust
// Custom errors using thiserror with early returns
#[derive(Debug, Error)]
pub enum DataError {
    #[error("Data not found: {0}")]
    NotFound(String),
    
    #[error("Permission denied")]
    PermissionDenied,
    
    #[error("Database error: {0}")]
    DatabaseError(#[from] DbError),
}

// Building complex error chains
fn process_data() -> Result<Data, DataError> {
    let config = read_config().context("Failed to read configuration file")?;
    let conn = establish_connection(&config).context("Failed to establish DB connection")?;
    
    // Conditional early return
    if !has_permission(&conn, &config.user_id) {
        return Err(DataError::PermissionDenied);
    }
    
    // Continue processing...
    Ok(data)
}
```

## Rust-Specific Best Practices

### Memory Management and Ownership
- Clear ownership design (owning, borrowing, reference counting)
- Appropriate use of smart pointers (Box, Rc, Arc)
- Balance between minimizing and explicitly annotating lifetimes
- Thorough documentation and isolation of unsafe code

### Leveraging the Type System
- Domain modeling through types
- Enhance type safety with the newtype pattern
- Effective use of trait bounds
- Strategic use of generics and associated types
- State management at the type level (typestate pattern)

### Concurrency and Asynchronous Processing
- Consistent use of tokio or async-std
- Proper composition and management of Futures
- Ensuring thread safety (Send, Sync)
- Identifying and optimizing concurrency bottlenecks
- Preventing deadlocks and race conditions

### Performance Optimization
```rust
// Data-oriented design
struct Entity {
    // Group data that is frequently accessed together
    position: Position,
    velocity: Velocity,
    
    // Rarely accessed data in separate structures
    metadata: Arc<EntityMetadata>,
}

// Zero-cost abstractions
pub trait Logger {
    fn log(&self, message: &str);
}

// Static dispatch resolved at compile time
pub fn process<L: Logger>(logger: &L, data: &[u8]) {
    // ...processing...
    logger.log("Processing complete");
}

// Vector processing optimization
fn transform_data(data: &mut [f32]) {
    // Explicit vectorization via iterator chains
    data.chunks_exact_mut(4)
        .for_each(|chunk| {
            // Opportunity for SIMD optimization
            for value in chunk {
                *value = value.sqrt() * 2.0;
            }
        });
}
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive coverage with unit tests (#[test])
- Functional verification with integration tests (#[test] in tests/)
- API documentation verification with doctests (/// ```rust)
- Edge case detection with property-based testing (quickcheck, proptest)
- Early discovery of security vulnerabilities through fuzz testing

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automatic execution of cargo check, cargo clippy, cargo fmt
- Cross-platform builds and testing
- Continuous measurement of benchmarks and detection of performance regressions
- Vulnerability scanning of dependencies (cargo audit)
- Measurement and monitoring of code coverage

### Refactoring and Maintenance
- Practice of incremental refactoring
- Maintaining backward compatibility (adherence to semver principles)
- Explicit distinction between stable and unstable APIs
- Planned resolution of technical debt

## Project Management and Communication

### Dependency Management
- Explicitly specify crates to be used in advance and document in Cargo.toml
- Set appropriate version constraints (^0.5, ~1.0, =1.2.3)
- Investigate internal dependencies of dependent crates as needed (cargo tree)
- Regular auditing and updating of dependencies (cargo update)
- Document rationale for crate selection and alternatives considered

### Development Workflow
- Always seek clarification for uncertainties before beginning work
- Create and share design documents prior to complex implementations
- Use clear checklists for code reviews
- Utilize templates for issues and pull requests
- Reconsider your plan if you fail to operate on the same file twice
